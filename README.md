Introduction: Dailies Notes Assistant (DNA)
===========================================
DNA (Dailies Note Assistant) is an open initiative under the Academy Software Foundation to create a platform to unify manual note taking, version context, and transcriptions. This empowers studios to build tools to enhance the accuracy and speed at which creative notes are passed to artsits for dailies sessions. It aims to explore how large-language-model-assisted transcription and summarization can meaningfully enhance the VFX dailies note-taking process, prioritizing practical utility and thoughtful support for production professionals. This is the first project proposed in the [ASWF Machine Learning Workgroup](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/issues/1029)

To get involved, see user stories, understand workflow and much more please visit the [WIKI](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/dna/wiki/Get-Involved)

The goals of this project are detailed in the [original proposal](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/issues/1040)

## **Why DNA?**

Today, review notes are usually taken by a single coordinator who has to follow the entirety of a meeting perfectly as it jumps around with different feedback associated with different media and tasks.

This can lead to:

- Lost context and feedback between reviews
- No standard for note taking
- Inconsistent version tracking
- Limited interoperability
- Poor AI usability

With DNA, review workflows become:

- **Clear** - notes tied to exact frames, versions, and context
- **Continuous** - feedback carries forward across iterations
- **Connected** - works across review tools, trackers, and pipelines
- **AI-ready** - structured data enables summaries, actions, and insights

DNA seeks to be an open-source, integratable tool that improves accuracy and efficiency in capturing review feedback without removing essential coordinator responsibilities.
### **1\. A Standard Note Format**

A shared structure for:

- Who gave the note
- When it was given
- What frame/timecode it applies to
- Which version it belongs to
- Status (open, resolved, etc.)
- Relationships (replies, carry-forward)

### **2\. A Workflow Model**

Based on real production workflows:

- Live review Dailies sessions
- Multi-user collaboration
- Version iteration cycles
- Note carry-forward

### **3\. A Foundation for AI**

Because notes are structured, you can:

- Turn transcripts into usable notes
- Auto-generate summaries
- Extract actionable tasks
- Track feedback across versions

**Example Workflow:**

1\. Director gives notes during review

2\. Notes are captured (manually or via transcription)

3\. Notes are structured using DNA

4\. Notes attach to a version + timecode

5\. Teams track progress without re-copying anything
