# DCO Signoff Requirement

When making git commits in this repository, **always** include the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) signoff.

## Rules

1. When using the `mcp_GitKraken_git_add_or_commit` tool or any git commit operation, always add the signoff line to the commit message.

2. The signoff line format is:
   ```
   Signed-off-by: Name <email@example.com>
   ```

3. When crafting commit messages, append a blank line followed by the signoff at the end of the message.

4. If running git commands directly in the terminal, always use the `-s` or `--signoff` flag:
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "commit message"
   ```

This ensures compliance with the Developer Certificate of Origin as required by this project.
